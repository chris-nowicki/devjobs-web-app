## My process

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Next Themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes)
- [Tailwindcss](https://www.tailwindcss.com)
- JSON

### What I learned

I wanted to focus on learning the new experimental /app directory offered by [Next.js](https://www.nextjs.org).  I learned how to implement dynamic page rendering server side based on the `id` of the job to pull that job info from the JSON file.

### Continued development

-[] Add Login/Auth feature
-[] Add feature to save jobs
-[] Add feature to add new jobs if you are an employer
-[] Move data over to a database
